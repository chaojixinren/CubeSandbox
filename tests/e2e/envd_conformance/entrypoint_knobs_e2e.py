"""End-to-end check that a deployment can tune envd through the entrypoint.

Run as a normal user: python3 entrypoint_knobs_e2e.py /path/to/cube-envd

This is the deployment-path counterpart of the cgroup checks in
`termination_e2e.py` (which export `CUBE_ENVD_CGROUP_*` when they launch the
daemon): the knobs added for the `/files` pipeline are reachable from the
environment *and* from flags, and the only user-facing way to pass flags is
`ENVD_EXTRA_ARGS` in `docker/cube-entrypoint.sh`. Nothing else in the suite runs
the entrypoint, so without this test "the deployment can set the knobs" was an
untested claim.

What it asserts, through the entrypoint and the real binary:

  1. the entrypoint starts envd with `ENVD_EXTRA_ARGS` and `/health` answers;
  2. envd's startup line reports the values the flags asked for — with the
     environment deliberately set to *different* values, which also pins that
     the flag wins;
  3. the cap is enforced: with `-download-max-bodies` at the floor, `CAP + 1`
     concurrent large downloads give `CAP` bodies and one `503`, while a body
     that fits in one chunk stays exempt (`200`) even with every slot held.

Only the daemon, one temporary directory and its log file are created here.
