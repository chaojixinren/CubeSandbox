//! Per-process output bus: one publisher (the pipe/pty pump, plus the
//! supervisor for control events) and one subscription per attached stream
//! (`process.Process/Start`, each `process.Process/Connect`).
//!
//! Policy
//! ------
//! * **Slow is not dead.** A subscriber that is behind applies backpressure:
//!   the pump stops reading the child's pipe, the pipe fills, and the child
//!   blocks in `write`. Nothing is dropped, so a slow consumer still receives
//!   every byte.
//! * **Only a stalled subscriber is evicted.** A subscriber that is *waiting*
//!   and has made no progress for [`DEFAULT_EVICT_AFTER`] is disconnected with
//!   `resource_exhausted`, so a client that stays connected but never reads
//!   cannot pin the pump — the failure mode upstream
//!   [e2b-dev/runtime#3292](https://github.com/e2b-dev/runtime/issues/3292)
//!   reports for a blocking fan-out.
//! * **Terminal events are guaranteed.** Every queue keeps one slot reserved
//!   for its terminal frame through a resident `OwnedPermit`, so `End` is
//!   delivered even when every data slot is full, and the frame order (data
//!   before `End`) is preserved.
//! * **Control events are best-effort.** `DeadlineExceeded` only *hints* that
//!   the process was killed by its deadline; the stream trailer is decided
//!   out-of-band from `EndEvent.killed_by`, so a dropped hint cannot
//!   misreport the stream as a normal exit.
